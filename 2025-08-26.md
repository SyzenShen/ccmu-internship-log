🧬 实习日志 第29天｜BLASTN比对与BED文件生成验证、月末总结
**日期：2025年8月26日**
**地点：首都医科大学生信实验室，iTerm2 + 本地Mac**

---

## 💡 今日完成的工作

* 对这个月做过的实验步骤和分析流程做了一次整理和复盘，尤其是关于序列比对和局部组装的部分，把关键的命令和文件都重新检查了一遍。
* 在比对结果里，确认了一些区域的覆盖深度和拼接效果，把容易出问题的地方做了笔记，方便以后查找。
* 把BLASTN比对与BED文件生成的命令和操作写进了脚本，避免下次重复手敲，提高效率。

## 📚 本月收获与成长

* **技能方面**：
  这个月我基本上把 Linux 命令、数据处理和一些常用的生物信息学工具跑通了。刚开始时经常会卡在很小的报错上，但现在能比较快地定位问题，也知道该去查哪里。做富集分析和画图的时候，感觉自己对 R 的掌握也有了一点进步，能独立画出科研用的图表。
* **思维方式**：
  比起刚来时的“照着教程跑”，我现在更能理解为什么要做某一步，也会去想结果是否合理，而不是只关心有没有跑完。对科研里的“可重复性”和“严谨性”有了更深刻的体会。
* **写作与表达**：
  论文阅读方面，我学会了把复杂的技术步骤转化成更容易理解的语言，也尝试在综述里找应用场景，而不仅仅是罗列概念。

## 🌱 感悟

这个月的实习让我感受到科研和课堂学习的不同。课堂上更多是知识点的记忆和理解，而在实验室里，真正的挑战是把零散的知识点拼接起来解决实际问题。
我发现自己有三个明显的变化：

1. **更有耐心**：以前遇到一直报错很有压力，现在知道科研里“卡壳”是常态，解决问题的过程反而是成长最快的时候。
2. **独立性增强**：虽然我还经常需要请教老师或借助 GPT，但我开始尝试先自己推理一遍，再去对照别人的答案，而不是一上来就依赖。
3. **认识更清晰**：我逐渐意识到，生物信息学不仅仅是敲命令，更重要的是能解释结果背后的生物学意义。这让我觉得未来如果走医学工程方向，需要既懂工具又懂医学背景。

同时我也发现了自己的不足：

* 编程功底还是不够扎实，Python 和 R 还停留在“会用”的层面，缺少系统性的学习。
* 对统计学理解不够深，有时候只能照搬分析流程，解释结果时底气不足。

---

## 🔄 本月总结

* 这个月是我从“新手”到“入门”的一个阶段。最大的收获不是掌握了多少个命令，而是逐渐学会用研究者的视角去看问题。
* 我体会到科研并不是追求快，而是追求“清晰”和“可复现”。哪怕花一天时间只解决一个小报错，也可能是非常值得的。
* 我开始意识到，未来要想在医学工程领域站稳脚跟，既要有编程能力，又要懂生物和医学原理，这样才不会变成只会按键的“工具人”。

## 🎯 下一阶段计划

* 继续整理实习中的操作步骤，把它们转化为能放进简历和项目经历的成果。
* 保持每天一点点的进度，即使不在实验室，也不断线。

🧬 Internship Log Day 29 | BLASTN Alignment & BED File Generation and Validation, End-of-Month Summary  
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Location:** Capital Medical University Bioinformatics Lab, iTerm2 + Local Mac  

---

## 💡 Work Completed Today  

- Reviewed and summarized the experimental steps and analysis workflows conducted this month, particularly focusing on sequence alignment and local assembly. Double-checked key commands and files.  
- Verified the coverage depth and assembly effectiveness in certain regions of the alignment results. Took notes on potential issues for future reference.  
- Documented the commands and operations for BLASTN alignment and BED file generation into scripts to avoid manual retyping and improve efficiency in the future.

## 📚 Monthly Gains and Growth  

- **Skills Development**:  
  This month, I became proficient with Linux commands, data processing, and commonly used bioinformatics tools. Initially, I often got stuck on minor errors, but now I can quickly identify issues and know where to look for solutions. While performing enrichment analysis and creating visualizations, I felt my understanding of R improved, and I can now independently generate charts suitable for scientific research.  

- **Mindset Shift**:  
  Compared to simply following tutorials at the beginning, I now better understand the purpose behind each step and consider whether the results are reasonable, rather than just focusing on completing the tasks. I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of "reproducibility" and "rigor" in scientific research.  

- **Writing and Expression**:  
  In reading research papers, I learned to translate complex technical steps into more understandable language. I also tried to identify application scenarios in reviews rather than merely listing concepts.

## 🌱 Reflections  

This month’s internship made me realize the differences between scientific research and classroom learning. Classroom learning often involves memorizing and understanding knowledge points, while in the lab, the real challenge lies in piecing together scattered knowledge to solve practical problems.  

I noticed three significant changes in myself:  

1. **Increased Patience**: I used to feel stressed when encountering persistent errors, but now I understand that "getting stuck" is a normal part of research. The process of solving problems is where the fastest growth happens.  
2. **Greater Independence**: Although I still frequently seek guidance from mentors or use tools like GPT, I now try to reason through problems myself before comparing my approach to others’, rather than relying on external help immediately.  
3. **Clearer Understanding**: I gradually realized that bioinformatics is not just about executing commands but, more importantly, about interpreting the biological significance behind the results. This made me aware that if I pursue a future in medical engineering, I will need to understand both the tools and the medical context.  

At the same time, I also identified my shortcomings:  

- My programming skills are still not solid enough. My knowledge of Python and R remains at a "functional" level, lacking systematic learning.  
- My understanding of statistics is insufficient. Sometimes I can only follow analysis workflows without fully grasping the interpretation of results.  

---

## 🔄 Monthly Summary  

- This month marked my transition from a "beginner" to an "entry-level" researcher. The biggest gain was not mastering a certain number of commands but gradually learning to approach problems from a researcher’s perspective.  
- I learned that scientific research is not about speed but about "clarity" and "reproducibility." Even spending an entire day solving a minor error can be highly worthwhile.  
- I began to realize that to establish myself in the field of medical engineering in the future, I need both programming skills and an understanding of biological and medical principles. This way, I won’t become just a "tool operator."  

---

## 🎯 Next Phase Plan  

- Continue organizing the operational steps from the internship and transform them into achievements that can be included in my resume and project portfolio.  
- Maintain daily progress, even when not in the lab, to stay connected and engaged.
